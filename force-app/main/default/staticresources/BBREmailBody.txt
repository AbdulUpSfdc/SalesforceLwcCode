AT&T has started charging me $9.99 a month for a Regional Sports Fee. They are telling me it is part of my contract that I signed in 1997 but they can not provide me a copy of the contract or any paperwork that shows anything about the fee. They have not been charging me the fee since 1997. It just appeared on my bill about a year ago. I have contacted them several times about this issue and I can not get a straight answer. Also in May of 2020 we wanted to have a wired box added to one of our bedrooms. We confirmed with AT&T over the phone that there would not be a charge to install the box and it would not lock us into a contract. When the guy showed up to install the box he said it would be hard to install a wired box because of paneling walls. He wanted to install a wireless box but told us it would be $100.00 to install the wireless. We refused to pay the $100 so he called his manager and they told him to install it at no charge. We never agreed to start a new contract with AT&T and neve agreed to pay a $100 installation fee. Since May of this year AT&T went up on our bill, could not provide proof as to why we are getting charged $9.99 Regional Sports Fee so we decided to cancel our service with them. I have been a loyal customer since 1997 but they are now impossible to deal with. AT&T sent me a final bill saying I am locked into a contract and they are charging me a disconnect fee of $230.00 plus taxes and fees for a total of $237.89.

       AT&T said they would not charge me the disconnect fee so I not have a zero balance with them. I am happy about that.  I am still needing information as to why they were charging me $9.99 a month for a regional sports fee. I have asked for documentation of the contract and proof that my area is in the zone for the fee. I would like proof that this is a legitimate fee or I would like a refund for every month AT&T charged me the $9.99 regional sports fee.
